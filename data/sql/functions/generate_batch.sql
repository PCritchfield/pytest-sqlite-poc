-- Function to generate a batch of mail items for printing
-- This creates a print job and adds items to the print queue

-- Note: In SQLite, we can't directly create stored procedures like in other databases
-- Instead, we'll define a series of SQL statements that can be executed in sequence

-- Step 1: Create a new print job
-- INSERT INTO print_jobs (name, description, status, scheduled_date)
-- VALUES (:job_name, :job_description, 'queued', datetime('now'));

-- Step 2: Get the ID of the newly created job
-- SELECT last_insert_rowid() AS job_id;

-- Step 3: Add mail items to the print queue
-- INSERT INTO print_queue (job_id, item_id, print_order, status)
-- SELECT 
--     :job_id,
--     item_id,
--     ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY priority DESC, created_at ASC) as print_order,
--     'queued'
-- FROM mail_items
-- WHERE status = 'pending'
-- AND (:campaign_id IS NULL OR campaign_id = :campaign_id)
-- ORDER BY priority DESC, created_at ASC
-- LIMIT :batch_size;

-- Step 4: Return the number of items added to the queue
-- SELECT COUNT(*) AS items_added
-- FROM print_queue
-- WHERE job_id = :job_id;
