# Code Quality Improvement Plan

This document outlines a phased approach to improving code quality in the pytest-sqlite-poc project.

## Current Status

We've integrated several code quality tools:
- Black (code formatter)
- isort (import sorter)
- Flake8 (linter with docstring checking)
- mypy (type checker)
- Bandit (security linter)
- pre-commit hooks

We've configured these tools with temporary leniency to allow for a gradual improvement process.

## Issues to Address

### Phase 1: Basic Code Formatting (Completed)
- ✅ Configure Black and isort
- ✅ Set up pre-commit hooks
- ✅ Fix line length issues
- ✅ Fix trailing whitespace
- ✅ Fix unused imports

### Phase 2: Type Annotations (Next)
- Add type annotations to function parameters and return values
- Focus on:
  - `data/sample_data.py` - Add type annotations for dictionaries
  - `tests/conftest.py` - Fix tuple type mismatches
  - Add type hints to all public functions

### Phase 3: Security Improvements
- Address Bandit security warnings:
  - Replace `random` with more appropriate alternatives where needed
  - Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities by using parameterized queries
  - Document cases where `random` is acceptable for non-security purposes

### Phase 4: Docstring Standardization
- Standardize docstring format (Google style)
- Ensure all modules have proper docstrings
- Ensure all public functions have proper docstrings
- Update flake8 configuration to enforce docstring standards

### Phase 5: Code Complexity Reduction
- Refactor complex functions (e.g., `insert_sample_data` in conftest.py)
- Improve test organization
- Reduce duplicate code

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Small, Focused PRs**: Each improvement should be made in small, focused PRs
2. **Test-Driven**: Ensure tests pass after each change
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation as code improves
4. **Gradual Enforcement**: Gradually increase the strictness of linting rules

## Timeline

- Phase 1: Complete
- Phase 2: Next sprint
- Phases 3-5: Subsequent sprints, prioritized based on project needs

## Monitoring Progress

Track progress by:
1. Reducing the number of linting exceptions in configuration files
2. Increasing the percentage of type-annotated code
3. Eliminating security warnings
4. Improving docstring coverage
